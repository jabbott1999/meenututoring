                        <p>
                            I am a native, CELTA qualified (Grade A) teacher of English. I have been teaching English for almost ten years. I specialise in teaching EFL (English as a Foreign Language) to adults.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After graduating with an LL.B (Hons) Law degree, I started a career in advertising research. After several years of working in this industry, I decided to pursue a career in television. I worked as a researcher for documentaries and factual entertainment for various companies including the BBC and ITV.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I discovered teaching some years later and taught in private language schools in London for eight years. Last year, I finally decided to leave the rat race behind and start my own venture in what I do best...teaching!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am an enthusiastic and friendly teacher and it gives me great satisfaction from seeing students achieve their goals. I am very passionate about teaching and I believe this is reflected in the positive feedback I have received throughout my training and employment.

                        <p>
                            I have been teaching English online for over a year. In my experience as a teacher, face to face contact is always a better option, however, learning a language online also has many benefits and through my experience I have come across useful tools which help in my teaching. I use an interactive whiteboard called BitPaper in all of my lessons. It is simple and fun to use and allows both teacher and student to interact effectively.

                            Due to the recent Corona virus outbreak, all lessons will be held online. Once government restrictions are eased, face to face lessons will resume.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have been teaching English online for over a year. In my experience as a teacher, face to face contact is always a better option, however, learning a language online also has many benefits and through my experience I have come across useful tools which help in my teaching. I use an interactive whiteboard called BitPaper in all of my lessons. It is simple and fun to use and allows both teacher and student to interact effectively.
